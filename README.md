## Project: Investigate a Dataset - No Show Appointments

### Introduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. Some of the columns are;
* 'PatientId': uniquely identifies the each Patients
* 'AppointmentID': Unique identifier for appointments
* 'Gender': Indicates the whether the patient is a Male or Female
* ‘ScheduledDay’: tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
* ‘Neighborhood’: indicates the location of the hospital.
* ‘Scholarship’ : indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
* 'No-Show': shows Patients that showed the appointment respone. i.e ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
* 'Scholarship', 'Hipertension', 'Diabetes', 'Alcoholism' and 'Handcap': Shows whether the patients have these illness or not.


### Questions for Analysis
* What Gender and Age Group has the highest number of Patients?
* How many patients showed up for their appointments compared to those who failed to show up?
* What Gender of the patients showed up for appointment the most?
* What age category showed up the most for their appointments?
* How many Patients got enrolled in the government scholarship showed up for their appointments?
* How many Patients who got SMS reminder message showed up for their appointments compared to those who did not get the reminder?
* How many of the patients who showed up for their appointments suffer from Hipertension, Diabetes and Alcoholism?
* What are the Top 10 Most Popular & Least Neighbourhood Hospitals?


### Conclusions
From the analysis carried out;

* 80% of patients showed up for their appointments and they have very low record of the listed illnesses in the data set, this is really a good indicator that people are concerned about their Health. However attention should also be paid to the remaining 20% patients that failed to show up for their appointments.

* This analysis reveals that SMS reminder message and the Brasilian welfare program does not have any significant impact on patient's availability for their appointments. The hospital should adopt other measures that can help improve Patient's availability for their appointments.

* There are also more Female patients than male, a research can be made to find out the cause of this, especially within the Neighbourhoods.

* These patients are mostly Children and Adults,the Hospital can also look into the cause of that.

* The analysis also showed that Hospitals in Jardim Camburi, Maria Oritz, Itarare, Resistencia and Centro Neighbourhood has the largest number of No - Show appointments. The reason for this should also be looked into.

* Limitation: This data does not include the distance between patient's location and the Hospital, which is an important factor in identifying the reason for some patient's failure to show up for their appointments
